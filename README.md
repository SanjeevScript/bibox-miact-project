# BiBox MiAct Project - GreenHouse

This is an Arduino-based project designed to emulate a self-sustainable greenhouse. The project uses various components such as sensors and actuators to open the roof of the greenhouse when it detects rain so it can be self-sustainable.
## Hardware Components

- Arduino [Model] (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- [Component 1] (e.g., Temperature Sensor)
- [Component 2] (e.g., Servo Motor, LED)
- [Additional Components] (e.g., Breadboard, Jumper Wires)

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Servo.h

## Installation

1. Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and install any necessary libraries:
   - Go to `Sketch` → `Include Library` → `Manage Libraries...` to install libraries.
4. Open the project code in the IDE, select your board and port, and upload the code to the Arduino.

## Usage

1. After uploading the code, your Arduino system should begin operating as designed.
